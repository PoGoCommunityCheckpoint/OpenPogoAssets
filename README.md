We've worked hard to bring you free-to-use Pokemon Go assets for your projects. All files in this reposity were created by a designer funded by [Jay Turner](https://github.com/TurnrDev) and other [fundraisers](FUNDRAISERS.MD).

## Sponsor
If you like this project, please consider [donating](https://www.gofundme.com/f/TrainerDex-PoGoMedals) to help fund the creating of extra assets.

## Attribution
You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
